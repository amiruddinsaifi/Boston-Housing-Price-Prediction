# Boston-housing-price-pridictions
Boston housing price prediction ml project. 
In this project, we use the Boston Housing dataset to train an optimal decision tree algorithm to predict the best selling price of a home in Boston based on certain features of the homes and statistical analysis.
we will develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from houses in Bostonâ€™s suburbs.

# Install

This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn

# project Steps

1.Data Preprocessing

2.Define Error

3.split the data into two part: training and test data

4.Train the model this step 'learning' the largest function from the givan training set. Choose the appropriate

machine learning algorithm for problem. train it on the data and test using test data set.

5.Prediction: Obtain the prediction values on givan input and visualize it.
